I am currently a Master's student at the University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science and a graduate affiliate at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), where I am supervised by [Quaid Morris](http://www.morrislab.ca/).

My reserach applies machine learning to solve challenges in cancer biology. In particular, I am interested in time series modelling of cancer evolution. My thesis work applies latent neural ODE models to generatively model cancer population dynamics.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto in Computer Science, and spent a year working as an SDE at Amazon.
