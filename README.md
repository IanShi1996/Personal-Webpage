# Ian's Personal Website
This repository contains my personal website. 

It was originally forked from https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/, but has since been modified to have a single page design. Unneeded components such as jekyll-scholar (opting for manual publication, low pub count makes this feasible...) have been removed.

For further information, visit the al-folio repo.
